In this paper, we aim at making a step towards a unified approach for image editing. To do so, we propose EdiBERT, a bi-directional transformer trained in the discrete latent space built by a vector-quantized auto-encoder. We argue that such a bidirectional model is suited for image manipulation since any patch can be re-sampled conditionally to the whole image. Using this unique and straightforward training objective,
