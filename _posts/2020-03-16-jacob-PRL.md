In this paper, we propose DIABLO, a dictionary-based attention method for image embedding. DIABLO produces richer representations by aggregating only visually-related features together while being easier to train than other attention-based methods in deep metric learning. This is experimentally confirmed on four deep metric learning datasets (Cub-200-2011, Cars-196, Stanford Online Products, and In-Shop Clothes Retrieval) for which DIABLO shows state-of-the-art performances.
