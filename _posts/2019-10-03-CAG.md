In this paper, we tackle the problem of human pose estimation from still images, which is a very active topic, specially due to its several applications, from image annotation to human-machine interface. We use the soft-argmax function to convert feature maps directly to body joint coordinates, resulting in a fully differentiable framework. Our method is able to learn heat maps representations indirectly, without additional steps of artificial ground truth generation.
