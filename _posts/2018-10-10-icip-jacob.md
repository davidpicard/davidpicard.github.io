Most image retrieval methods use global features that aggregate local distinctive patterns into a single representation. However, the aggregation process destroys the relative spatial information by considering orderless sets of local descriptors. We propose to integrate relative spatial information into the aggregation process by taking into account co-occurrences of local patterns in a tensor framework.
